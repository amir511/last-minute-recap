    OOP:
        ☐ Encapsulation:
            ☐ Hiding of data implementation by restricting access to them (Done by accessors and mutators)
            ☐ Packing of Data Methods into a single component (done in objects by the means of classes)

        ☐ Inheritance:
            ☐ subclasses inherits the attributes and methods of its super classes
        
        ☐ Polymorphism:
            ☐ The ability of one object to have more than a single implementation - One name many forms
            ☐ Method override, The method in the class have an implementation while have another one in the subclass.
            ☐ Method/operator overloading, Overloading means method with same names but with different arguments will have different behaviour

        ☐ Abstraction:
            ☐ Hiding all details of a certain object that do not concern us and only uses the details, which are relevant to the problem we are solving
