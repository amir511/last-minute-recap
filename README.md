# Last-Minute Interview Recap for Python|Django|PostgreSQL Stack

As a self-taught developer, I've often struggled with technical interviews due to gaps in my knowledge. While I'm confident in my ability to excel in the job, I've never studied computer science in college, leaving me with missing pieces of the puzzle.

Over time, I've noticed that certain topics come up repeatedly in technical interviews, and I've made it my mission to study them thoroughly. On this website, you'll find my list of frequently asked technical interview questions, with a special focus on Django positions.

Not only have I compiled a comprehensive list of questions, but I've also included answers and explanations for each one. If I've sourced material from external sources, I've provided proper attribution. In some cases, I've even provided a curated list of the best sources to explore each topic further.

Don't let your technical interview hold you back any longer â€“ explore my collection of questions and answers to boost your knowledge and confidence. Enjoy!
